	  We propose a novel idea of revealing the origin of enhanced circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding a core-collapse supernova by detecting neutrinos at multiple energies. 
	  In this method, assuming CSM is formed by the release of neutrinos in a pre-explosion burning phase, the following emission of high-energy neutrinos is considered. 
	  As a demonstration of the proposed idea, we estimated the signal event rate at JUNO and IceCube in comparison with background rate expected at each detector.

	  I proposed a new comprehensive framework for the diffuse fluxes of core-collapse supernova-origin neutrinos due to two distinctive physical processes.
