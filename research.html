	</a>
	<div class="collapse" id="detail_8">
	<div class="card card-body">
	  We focused on the fact that the emitted neutrino spectrum from core-collapse supernovae changes depending on the fate of stellar core-collapse and therefore the diffuse supernova neutrino background measurement can potentially provide constraints on this part. 
	  We investigated their flux shape for different cases of the core-collapse remnant being a typical mass neutron star, a higher mass neutron star, or a black hole from the failed supernova. 
	  We also performed the sensitivity study to make constraints on the composition of these three, based on assumptions for the future water-based Cherenkov detectors, SK-Gd and Hyper-Kamiokande. 
	  The result is summarized in a paper (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac8a46">link</a>).

	  As a research project in the CERN summer student program, I was working on the beam intensity measurement in the LHC-ATLAS experiment.

	  I studied the potential systematic uncertainty coming from this assumption by changing the beam shape in a toy MC simulation. 
          I also analysed the vdM scan data observed by the IBL detector and measured the beam intensity roughly.
