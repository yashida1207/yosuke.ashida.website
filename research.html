	  I was working as an expert of the muon monitor for T2K. 
	  Here I managed the calibration and trouble shootings in the experimental operation and performed various studies for the current and future beam monitors. 
	  We investigated the issues with the current detectors, silicon sensors and ion chambers, and confirmed their responses to the beam power. 
	  As a new candidate for the future detector, replacing with the current ones, we proposed electron-multiplier tubes (EMTs) and tested with the prototype sensors. 
	  The results are published in a paper (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ptep/article/2018/10/103H01/5145636?login=false">link</a>).
	  The follow-up studies at an electron beam facility have been made towards actual installation in J-PARC, as summarized in a paper (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05877">link</a>).

	<div class="collapse" id="detail_3">
	<div class="card card-body">
	  We conducted beam tests at Osaka University’s Research Center for Nuclear Physics (RCNP) to measure production cross sections of &gamma;-rays arising from the neutron-oxygen reaction. 
	  This is motivated by the large systematic uncertainty regarding the relevant cross sections in the neutrino neutral-current measurement in T2K. 
	  The measurement results are summarized in papers (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.109.014620">link</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15366">link</a>). 
	  As a necessary technique to estimate the neutron background in the &gamma;-ray spectroscopy we investigated a CsI(Tl) scintillator capability of the pulse shape discrimination (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ptep/article/2018/4/043H01/4980960?login=false">link</a>)

	<div class="card card-body">
	  As a research project in the CERN summer student program, I was working on the beam intensity measurement in the LHC-ATLAS experiment. 
	  The beam intensity is measured by the van der Meer (vdM) scan in the collider experiment, where the Gaussian shape is assumed for the beam profile. 
	  I studied the potential systematic uncertainty coming from this assumption by changing the beam shape in a toy MC simulation. 
          I also analysed the vdM scan data observed by the IBL detector and measured the beam intensity roughly.
